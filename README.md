# 7linden-public-lxde

Create a .deb package (suitable for xbuntu, Debian, Linux Mint) that depends on a number of packages to create a saner public computer system.

It comes with scripts to create a guest-prefs user and autologins a guest user to an lxde session.

## Package building

To build the package you need to have [FPM](https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm) in the path and call `create.sh`.
